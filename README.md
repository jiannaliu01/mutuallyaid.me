## Why mutual aid? ðŸ”…
The ongoing pandemic (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected vulnerable demographics, such as Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour, especially those from lower-income communities. Circumstances have only been exacerbated by the civil unrest that has swept the nation, propelled by racial injustice and carceral/policing power structures.

Mutual aid, as a result, is more essential to our shared survival than ever. We believe that the sustenance of our communities â€” all of our communities â€” is the most pressing issue to address in these times.

## Why mutuallyaid.me? ðŸ”…
University students' requests for aid have largely been circulated via social media and personal messaging platforms. This makes it difficult for those without as much access to these platforms â€” as well as those who may wish to remain anonymous while asking for support â€” to get help.

**mutuallyaid.me** is a platform designed to consolidate aid requests within universities to increase visibility and accessibility. It is also an explicit request for those fortunate enough to spare personal finances in these times, to do so for their peers.

## Languages and libraries used ðŸ”…
We created **mutuallyaid.me** with [react.js](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for user interface development.
